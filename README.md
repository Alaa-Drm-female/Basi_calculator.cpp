# Calculator in C++

This project is a simple calculator written in C++ that can perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Supported Operations
1. **Addition**: Adds two values together.
2. **Subtraction**: Subtracts one value from another.
3. **Multiplication**: Multiplies two values.
4. **Division**: Divides one value by another, handling the division by zero case.
5. **Exit**: Exits the program.

## Features
- Interactive interface that allows the user to input values.
- Handles division by zero with a loop to check for valid input.
- Allows for basic arithmetic calculations in a simple console-based environment.

## How to Run
1. Install a C compiler like [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/).
2. Open your Command Prompt (Windows) or Terminal (macOS/Linux).
3. Navigate to the folder containing the project files.
4. Compile the program using the following command:
   ```bash
   g++ -o calculator calculator.cpp
GOOD LUCK ðŸ’šðŸ«°
